    <p class="JLrant"><strong>JURGEN LEITNER??????</strong> STUPID IDIOT ************* <strong>JURGEN LEITNER</strong> *** **** FOOL BOOK COLLECTING DUST EATING RAT OLD BASTARD ******** IDIOT AVATAR OF THE ***** <em>BIGGEST CLOWN IN THE CIRCUS</em> LAUGHED OUT OF TOWN COWBOY ************* <strong>JURGEN LEITNER?????????</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <em>STOP PINNING ME</em> WHEN I TALK ABOUT <strong>JURGEN LEITENER</strong> I HATE HIM SO MUCH WHY DOES HE HAVE SO MANY ****** UP BOOKS WHY DID HE DECIDE TO **** AROUND AND FIND OUT <em>JUST SET THEM LOOSE</em> IS HE <em>DEAD</em> <strong><em>IS HE A BASTARD</em></strong> MAN HAS SUCH A <em>VISCERAL</em> AFFECT ON ME NOT EVEN IN THE <em>ROOM</em> NEVER SEEN THIS MANS FACE AND I KNOW HE HAS THE WORLDS ********* BEARD <strong><em>GET AWAY FROM ME!!!!!!</em></strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      If I wanted to get into heaven and God said <strong><em>Jurgen Leitner's</em></strong> waiting inside <em>I would <strong>piss</strong> on <strong>God's feet</strong></em> for the sole purpose of getting sent back down.
      <br>
      <br>
      If I have to deal with <strong>Jurgen Leitner</strong> speaking <em>one word</em> in person on voice in podcast <strong>not only</strong> will I close the tab I will <strong><em>delete my bookmark</em></strong> out of <strong><em>spite</em></strong> and have to rewatch the <em>entire</em> series again for the experience of being able to skip all the times when he is <strong>mentioned</strong> or <strong><em>alive.</em></strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      I dont even know why I hate him so much. He collects books but I am just mad because I am angy.
      <br>
      <br>
      He better have some ****** up backstory to explain this if hes just some <em>rich</em> ******** whos a fan of creepypasta and wanted the irl version I'll go ham.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>BETTER</strong> have had a book make him kill a man cuz if he didnt <em>I'm going to make him.</em>
      <br>

      <strong><em>paypal.com/I*******HateJurgenLeitner</em></strong>
      <br>
      <br>
        Episodes not even about him. vaguely mentioned what is <em>supposed to maybe</em> be his library and <strong><em>I lost it.</em></strong>
      <br>
      <br>
        <em>Where the **** is <strong>Jurgen Leitner</strong></em> if hes still alive I'm going to <em>so deeply wish he wasnt.</em>
      <br>
      <br>
        <strong><em>Crusty Old Man.</em></strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      I'll punch <strong><em>Leitner</em></strong> and his <em>sad frail</em> old man <em>twig bones</em> will simply <em>flake apart</em> under my <strong><em>epic huge meat fist</em></strong> and he will <strong><em>disintegrate</em></strong> until all thats left is one final book he kept on him at all times simply titled Now You ****** Up in <strong><em>Ancient Yiddish.</em></strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm not breathing I'm <em>hyperventilating</em> at this point.
      <br>
      <br>
      I hope theres a date given for when <strong>jurgen</strong> <em>died</em> or <em>will die</em> so i can make it a <em>reminder on my phone.</em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Every day once a year I will see it and do <em>anything</em> but pay respects to the man who had so many ****** up if true books.
