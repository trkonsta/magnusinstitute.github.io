        <h3>Martin Blackwood</h3>

      <p>Martin K. Blackwood is an Archival Assistant to Jonathon Sims. Before moving to the archives Martin held a position in the library of the Magnus Institute.</p>
      <p>Martin enjoy's writing mediocre poetry and making tea for his colleagues :)
        <br>
        <br>
        Martin does <em>not</em> enjoy peaches or oolong tea. he <em>actively hates</em> peach oolong tea.
      <br>
      <br>
      Martin has excellent taste in sweaters and wears them all the time. We have seen him wear them in the middle of the summer. We're not sure how he manages it.
      <br>
      <br>
        Martin <em>definitely</em> has a masters in parapsychology.
      <br>
      <br>
      <em>After getting trapped in his flat by worms for thirteen days, Martin spent several months living in the archives document storage. The fact that he did not get eaten proves just how secure our documents are. If we could protect him from the flesh hive than we can surely be trusted with your stories. Your trauma is safe with us!</em>
        <br>
        <br>
        (Edit: Martin would like anyone reading this to know that the best way he found to remove flesh eating worms was via a corkscrew. Keep this in mind if you ever encounter an avatar of the corruption. )</p>

      <p>"I think our experience of the universe has value. Even if it disappears forever."
        <br>
        "You died Jon. I won't let it happen again."
        <br>
        "I love you. But I'm not going to doom the world over it"
      <br>
